# TreeICE

## Introduction 
We modify one of the state-of-the-art concept-based explanations (ICE ) and propose an alternative framework. Our algorithm employs ICE concepts to generate decision tree approximations for target deep learning computer vision models. This algorithm is capable of providing decision tree models with both global
and local explanations. 
TreeICE outperforms the baseline in interpretability and generates more human-readable explanations in the form of a semantic
tree structure.
